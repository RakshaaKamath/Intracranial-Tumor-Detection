# INTRACRANIAL TUMOR DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

## Abstract
Tumors are a major cancer threat, demanding fast, reliable automated detection, especially for brain tumors. Accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. Image processing techniques aid doctors in diagnosing and treating tumor patients, as tumors are uncontrolled cell growth. Brain tumors, in particular, disrupt healthy cell function and can lead to brain failure. Currently, manual MRI image analysis is time-consuming and less accurate. Deep Learning CNN (Convolution Neural Network) models can efficiently detect brain tumors, predicting their presence or absence in images.

## Result images
An MRI image from dataset used predict if the image has a brain scan with tumor or without tumor
